#financesManager is an application that aims on helping the user to manage their finances by getting an object with purchaseDate, purchaseClass(food, health, home) and the price and stores it in a MySQL table using hibernate persistency methods and allows the user to consult data from this table using HQL query (a personalized hibernate query language) and displays at the console and it can be selected by purchaseClass or purchaseDate. The program has some verification methods, such as not allowing the user to add a purchase that happens in the future, only being possible to add a purchase that happened in the current day or before it. It was created using Maven as a dependency manager. The program allows the user to create a profile and to access the profile using a userName and password, if it matches the data existent on the DB, the previous mentioned methods can be accessed, if there is no match, the program is stopped and it asks the user to verify the data inserted.
